Personal Profile
------
I am an Associate Professor in the School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China. I received my PhD degree in in computational mathematics from the School of Mathematical Sciences, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2009. My research centers around the affective computing, social media computing and high-fidelity simulation.

I am directing the ZZU Computational Learning Lab, where I work with the most brilliant students and colleagues worldwide to understand the information of feelings and emotions of human individuals and groups hidden in multi-modal data such as text, sound, image, video, and to design and study new virtual simulation and modeling methods to augment scientists' ability to explore vast amount of data on natural human-computer interaction or immersive virtual environment. Our current approaches combine psychological principles with mathematical modeling.

Introduction to the Subject Group
------
CLL —— Computational Learning Lab

A normal tinkering innovation is like a worm coming out of the bottom of a bamboo, it has to penetrate section by section before it can eventually crawl out, this is called a vertical exit.

Disruptive innovation is like a worm coming out by punching a hole through the side of the bamboo, without having to punch through section by section, which is called a horizontal exit.

The central problem of computational learning: Formalisation - the aim of all science, whether natural or social, is to reconcile our experiences with each other and to integrate them into a logical system!

I. Methods: 1. Deep Reinforcement Learning; 2. Multimodal Computing; 3. Swarm Intelligence.

II. Technical Paths: Algorithms + Application Scenarios -> Data Parsing, Visualisation, Simulation and Deduction, Autonomous Decision-making.

III. Application Scenarios: DC, Social Governance, etc.
