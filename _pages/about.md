Personal Profile
------

I am  an Associate Professor in the School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Zhengzhou University. Since 2023, I have been with Zhejiang Lab, where I am PI in the Research Institute of Artificial Intelligence. I have published more than 50 papers in international conference and journals, including the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE), the IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems (TCSS), the Computers & Graphics, the Science China-Information Sciences, etc. My current research interests include computer graphics, virtual reality, and reinforcement learning.

I am directing the ZZU Computational Learning Lab, where I work with the most brilliant students and colleagues worldwide to understand the information of feelings and emotions of human individuals and groups hidden in multi-modal data such as text, sound, image, video, and to design and study new virtual simulation and modeling methods to augment scientists' ability to explore vast amount of data on natural human-computer interaction or immersive virtual environment. Our current approaches combine psychological principles with mathematical modeling.

Introduction to the Subject Group
------
CLL —— Computational Learning Lab

A normal tinkering innovation is like a worm coming out of the bottom of a bamboo, it has to penetrate section by section before it can eventually crawl out, this is called a vertical exit.

Disruptive innovation is like a worm coming out by punching a hole through the side of the bamboo, without having to punch through section by section, which is called a horizontal exit.

The central problem of computational learning: Formalisation - the aim of all science, whether natural or social, is to reconcile our experiences with each other and to integrate them into a logical system!

I. Methods: 1. Deep Reinforcement Learning; 2. Multimodal Computing; 3. Swarm Intelligence.

II. Technical Paths: Algorithms + Application Scenarios -> Data Parsing, Visualisation, Simulation and Deduction, Autonomous Decision-making.

III. Application Scenarios: DC, Social Governance, etc.
